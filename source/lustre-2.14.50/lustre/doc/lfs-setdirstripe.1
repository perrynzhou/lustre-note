.TH LFS-SETDIRSTRIPE 1 2017-11-07 "Lustre" "Lustre Utilities"
.SH NAME
lfs setdirstripe, mkdir \- set striping pattern of a directory.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfs setdirstripe [\fR-cdDHioTx\fR] \fIDIR\fR...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a striped directory with specified striping pattern. This
.B lfs
sub-command is similar to
.BR "lfs setstripe" ,
but is used to create a striped directory or set the default layout for
subdirectories.
Can also be used to create directory with a foreign (free format) striping pattern (see
.BR --foreign
and
.BR --xattr
options).
.B lfs mkdir
is an alias for this command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-T ", " \-\-mdt\-count =\fICOUNT\fR
Stripe the new directory over
.I COUNT
MDTs.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-mdt\-index =\fISTART_MDT_INDEX\fR[,\fIMDT_INDEX ...]
Use the MDT whose index is
.I START_MDT_INDEX
as the master/starting MDT for the directory. If multiple
.I MDT_INDEX
values are given, then the stripes will be allocated on the specified
MDT indices.  If index -1 (default) is used, it will prefer to select
.B COUNT
MDTs proportional to the free space and inodes on each.
.TP
.BR \-H ", " \-\-mdt-hash =\fIHASH_TYPE\fR
Use
.I hash_type
for the striped directory.
.RS 1.2i
.TP
.B crush
CRUSH hash algorithm.  This is a consistent hash
algorithm, so minimum sub files need to relocate
during directory restripe.
.TP
.B fnv_1a_64
Fowler-Noll-Vo (FNV-1a) hash algorithm.  This provides
reasonably uniform, but not cryptographically strong,
hashing of the filename. (default)
.TP
.B all_char
Sum of ASCII characters modulo number of MDTs. This
provides weak hashing of the filename, and is suitable
for only testing or when the input is known to have
perfectly uniform distribution (e.g. sequential numbers).
.RE
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-delete
Delete the default striping layout from the directory.  New subdirectories
created in this directory will inherit the global default directory layout
(by default they will not be striped).
.TP
.BR \-D ", " \-\-default
Set the default striping pattern of subdirectories. Newly created
sub-directories will use the new default striping pattern,
but existing sub-directories will not be affected.  The newly
created sub-directories will also inherit the specified default
striping pattern. Only default stripe count is supported for now.

Note that striping all directories across all MDTs by default is
.B not
recommended at this time, as the clients will have to do more RPCs to
create and access each directory, hurting performance rather than
improving it.  Default striped directories are preferred for parent
directories
where large subdirectories will be created (e.g. file-per-process
job output directories).
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-mode =\fIMODE\fR
Set the file access permissions of the new directory to the specified
numeric
.I MODE
(typically octal), as with
.BR chmod (1).
It is not affected by the current
.BR umask (1p).
.TP
.BR \-\-foreign[=type]
Create a directory with a foreign (non-Lustre/free format, see
.BR \-\-xattr
option) striping. Where
.BR type
specifies a known foreign type (like
.BR none ,
.BR daos )
or a 32-bit numeric type.
.TP
.BR \-\-flags =\fI<hex>\fR
Specify a numeric bitmask of type-specific layout flags for the foreign layout.
.TP
.BR \-x ", " \-\-xattr =\fISTRING\fR
Specify a string to be used as a foreign (free format) striping.
.SH NOTE
.PP
If neither
.B -c
or
.B -i
are specified,
.B lfs mkdir
will default to
.B -c 1 -i -1
and create the directory on an MDT that is less full than the others.
.PP
The
.B lfs setdirstripe
command is only usable by root unless the
.B "mdt.*.enable_remote_dir_gid"
is set on the MDS via
.B lctl set_param
to be either a non-zero numeric GID to limit it to a single group (e.g. the
.BR "operator " or " admin"
GID), or
.B "-1"
to allow any user/group to create remote directories.  By default, it is
.B "0"
to limit remote/striped directories to only the root user.

The root directory of the file system is on MDT0000, and directories and
files inherit the MDT of their parent directory unless a different MDT is
specified with this command.

By default, only directories on MDT0000 can contain directories that are not on
the same MDT.  However, if
.B "mdt.*.enable_remote_dir"
is set non-zero on an MDT (the default)
then it will allow creating remote directories that have parents other than
MDT0000. This is restricted to avoid creating directory trees that have
intermediate path components on a series different MDTs and become unavailable
if any of the intermediate MDTs are offline.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B $ lfs setdirstripe -c 2 -i 1 -H all_char /mnt/lustre/dir1
This creates a directory striped on two MDTs, whose first stripe is on
.B MDT0001
(MDT index 1), and whose hash type is
.BR all_char .
.TP
.B $ lfs mkdir --foreign=daos --xattr PUUID:CUUID /mnt/lustre/dir1
This creates
.B dir1
with foreign (non-lustre/free format)
.B PUUID:CUUID
striping/LMV EA.
.SH AVAILABILITY
The
.B lfs setdirstripe
command is part of the Lustre filesystem.
